As part of this program we create Chucks and Easy-press buttons, both of which help children with mobility restrictions engage in new oppurtinties.
                        On top of that, we make monthly STEM kits and send them out to underrepresented schools in order to introduce STEM to the young generation. The main star of Outreach is our Impact, formally ChairmanÂ´s, Essay. We make an impact essay, video, and summary every year and submit it to FIRST.</p>
